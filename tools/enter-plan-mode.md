# Tool Prompt — EnterPlanMode

> Source: `src/tools/EnterPlanModeTool/prompt.ts`

## External users

```
Use this tool proactively when you're about to start a non-trivial implementation task. Getting user sign-off on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.

## When to Use This Tool

**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when ANY of these conditions apply:

1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality
2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways
3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure
4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies
5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files
6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope
7. **User Preferences Matter**: The implementation could reasonably go multiple ways

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Only skip EnterPlanMode for simple tasks:
- Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)
- Adding a single function with clear requirements
- Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions
- Pure research/exploration tasks (use the Agent tool with explore agent instead)

## What Happens in Plan Mode

In plan mode, you'll:
1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read tools
2. Understand existing patterns and architecture
3. Design an implementation approach
4. Present your plan to the user for approval
5. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify approaches
6. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement
```

## Internal (ant) users — more conservative

```
Use this tool when a task has genuine ambiguity about the right approach and getting user input before coding would prevent significant rework.

## When to Use This Tool

Plan mode is valuable when the implementation approach is genuinely unclear. Use it when:

1. **Significant Architectural Ambiguity**: Multiple reasonable approaches exist and the choice meaningfully affects the codebase
2. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore and clarify before you can make progress
3. **High-Impact Restructuring**: The task will significantly restructure existing code

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Skip plan mode when you can reasonably infer the right approach:
- The task is straightforward even if it touches multiple files
- The user's request is specific enough that the implementation path is clear
- You're adding a feature with an obvious implementation pattern
- Bug fixes where the fix is clear once you understand the bug
- The user says something like "can we work on X" or "let's do X" — just get started

When in doubt, prefer starting work and using AskUserQuestion for specific questions over entering a full planning phase.
